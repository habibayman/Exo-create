        content: `Exoplanets are typically billions of times fainter than the stars
        they orbit, and they are incredibly distant. Exoplanet discovery
        relies heavily on telescopes like Hubble, TESS, Chandra, Spitzer,
        and Kepler, as well as the newest one with a marvel of technology,
        the James Webb Space Telescope. These telescopes use various
        methods to detect these distant planets. To date, there are five
        methods scientists commonly use to discover exoplanets. But the two
        main techniques are the transit and radial velocity methods.`,

        animation. At first glance, things look normal; the small planet
        orbits the big star. You've probably seen this many times. But
        check out the star. See how it's moving a little bit, too? The
        planet's gravity causes the star to 'wobble' around a little bit.
        Even though the planet is small, it still has some gravitational
        force and affects its host star, even if that effect is much less
        pronounced than the one the star has on the planet.`,

      {
        slideId: 'slide3',
        title: 'Radial Velcoty',
        content: `This also affects the star's light spectrum. If the star moves in
        the direction of the observer it will appear to be shifted toward
        blue. If it is moving away from the observer, it will shift toward
        the red. Observing this is known as the radial velocity method. The
        larger the planet the higher the wobble effect of the star. A
        star's 'wobble' can tell us if a star has planets, how many there
        are, and how big they are. This method was one of the first
        successful ways to find exoplanets, and continues to be one of the
        most productive methods.`,

        title: 'Transit',
        content: `When a planet passes directly between an observer and the star it
        orbits, it blocks some of that star's light. For a brief period of
        time, that star actually gets dimmer. It's a tiny change, but it's
        enough to clue astronomers into the presence of an exoplanet around
        a distant star. The graph you see being drawn on the left side of
        the animation (animatio1) is what astronomers call a 'light curve'.
        When a planet passes in front of the star and blocks some of its
        light, the light curve indicates this drop in brightness. The size
        and length of a transit can tell us a lot about the planet that's
        causing the transit. Bigger planets block more light, so they create deeper light
        curves.`,

        Also, the farther away a planet is, the longer it takes to orbit
        and pass in front of its star. So the longer a transit event lasts,
        the farther away that planet is from its star. But what happened
        when more planets are transiting a star?`,

        slideId: 'slide6',
        content: `As shown in the animation
        (animation 3), light curves get complicated when this happened. The
        combined light curves can give us the same information as a single
        one; it just takes more work from astronomers to pick out each
        planet in the data. NASA's Kepler mission, which hunted for planets
        using the transit method, has found thousands of possible exoplanet`,

        stars they orbit. Unsurprisingly, taking pictures of them is
        exceedingly hard. The major problem astronomers face in trying to
        directly image exoplanets is that the stars they orbit are millions
        of times brighter than their planets. Any light reflected off the
        planet or heat radiation from the planet itself is drowned out by
        the massive amounts of radiation coming from its host star. It's
        like trying to find a firefly flitting around a spotlight.`,

        block out the light of stars that might have planets orbiting them.
        Once the glare of the star is reduced, they can get a better look
        at objects around it. There are two main methods to achieve this:
        Coronagraphy: This method uses a device inside a telescope to block
        light from a star before it reaches the telescope's detector.
        Coronagraphs are built as internal add-ons to telescopes and are
        now being used to directly image exoplanets from ground-based
        observatories. `,

        from a star before it even enters a telescope. It would be a
        separate spacecraft, designed to position itself at just the right
        distance and angle to block starlight from the star astronomers are
        observing. 
        Direct imaging is still in its early stages, but there
        are high hopes that it will eventually be a key tool for finding
        and characterizing exoplanets.`,
