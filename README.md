**ExoCreate** is an interactive educational platform developed for the **NASA Space Apps Hackathon**. It introduces young learners to the world of exoplanets through an engaging 3D experience. The platform features a user-friendly interface, accessibility from any device, and high-quality educational content designed to make complex topics approachable and interesting.

Students can explore planetary science, take quizzes to test their knowledge, and create their own exoplanets by adjusting various parameters, allowing for a fun and immersive learning experience.

# The Journey takes you through 3 planets 


// will insert a video here 




- **Planet 1** (Interactive 3D Learning): 
  This planet introduces students to exoplanets. Information on it is given through interactive slides. The slides also support Auditory learning by having a ‚Äúlisten to slide‚Äù button. making it also suitable for disabled kids! 
- **Planet 2** (Quiz Section): 
  This keeps them on their toes because, as research goes, students focus better knowing there is a quiz at the end of it. 
- **Planet 3** (A Planet Creation Game):
  A dedicated section to design and customize your own exoplanet based on your preferences. The student can put parameters into this game like temperature, water level, mountain height, and then a 3D model of it appears.
